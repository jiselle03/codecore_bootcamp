  # Rails guide on Associations
  # https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html

  # By default, 'belongs_to' will create a validation such as:
  # 'validates :question_id, presence: true'
  # It can be disabled by passing the option
  # 'optional: true' to the belongs_to method, for example:
  # belongs_to :question, optional: true

  # In association between two models, the model that has the
  # belongs_to method call is always the one whose table contains
  # the foreign key column (i.e. question)
  belongs_to :question
  # The following instance methods are added to the answer model
  # by the line belongs_to :question:
    # question
    # question=(associate)
    # build_question(attributes = {})
    # create_question(attributes = {})
    # create_question!(attributes = {})
    # reload_question
  
  # The above are instance methods that simplify interaction
  # with the associated question.

  validates :body, presence: true
