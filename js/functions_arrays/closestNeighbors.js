// Write a function, closestNeighbors, that takes an integer, n, and three other integers, a, b and c. Find the greatest integer smaller than n that is divisible by a, b and c and find the smallest integer greater than n that is also divisible by a, b, and c then return both results in an array.

// Example:

// closestNeighbors(20, 2, 3, 4) // [12, 24]
// closestNeighbors(100, 3, 4, 5) // [60, 120]
// closestNeighbors(3000, 7, 13, 31) // returns [2821, 5642]
